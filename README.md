# InceptionV3-TF-DogBreedClassifier
This is a copy of the Dog Breed Classifier I made for the Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity.

The ojective of the project was to create a program that will take an image as an input. The output would be:

1. Message indicating if a dog or human is detected
2. Classify the breed of the dog detected or give out the closest breed that resembles the detected human face.
3. Catch images that does not contain a human or a dog and output an error message.
